Welcome to Pythonect
====================

Welcome to Pythonect's documentation. This documentation is divided into
different parts. I recommend that you get started with :ref:`installation` and
then head over to the :ref:`tutorial`. If you'd rather dive into the internals
of Pythonect, check out the :ref:`api` documentation.

.. note::
   This is the main documentation for the Pythonect project. The contents of
   this site are automatically generated via `Sphinx <http://sphinx-
   doc.org/>`_ based on the Python docstrings throughout the code and the
   reStructuredText documents in the `doc/ directory
   <https://github.com/ikotler/pythonect/tree/master/doc>`_ of the git
   repository. If you find an error in the documentation, please report it in
   the bug tracker `here <https://www.github.com/ikotler/pythonect/issues>`__,
   or even better, submit a pull request!
